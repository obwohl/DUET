#             Project Packager for Large Language Model (LLM) Sessions
# ==============================================================================
# This script collects all key source files and a project structure overview
# into a single, clean directory named 'upload'. This allows for quick and
# easy context sharing in a new chat session.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Place this script in the root directory of your project.
# 2. Make it executable: chmod +x package_for_llm.sh
# 3. Run it from the root directory: ./package_for_llm.sh
# ==============================================================================

# --- 1. Configuration ---
# The name of the directory where all files will be collected.
UPLOAD_DIR="upload"

# An array of all relevant files to be included in the package.
# Add or remove files here as the project evolves.
